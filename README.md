# Spell-Corrector

This is used by some of our internal tool as an auto spelling corrector feature.
Similar to how "Did you mean" feature work but these are collected through out and placed into a A-Z text files for easy retrieving of the scripts.

The scripts are coded in Python, Javascript, vb6, etc and are used by some desktop apps and mobile apps.
